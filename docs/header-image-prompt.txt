# Header Image Prompt for DALL-E / ChatGPT

## Primary Prompt

```
Create a whimsical, cartoon-style illustration showing a friendly robot or 
developer character standing at a futuristic fast-food counter. Behind the 
counter is a digital menu board displaying cloud icons (generic clouds, 
databases, storage buckets) instead of food items. The server behind the 
counter is handing over a glowing "combo meal box" that has small cloud 
infrastructure icons floating out of it. Use bright, playful colors - blues, 
oranges, and yellows. Style should be modern, clean, and tech-friendly 
without referencing any specific brand. Include subtle Kubernetes helm 
wheel patterns in the background as decoration.
```

## Alternative Prompts

### Version 2: More Technical Focus

```
Create a modern, minimalist illustration of a cloud infrastructure ordering 
system styled like a fast-food menu. Show a large digital menu board on the 
left with items like "Developer Combo - S/M/L" and icons representing databases, 
storage, and networks. On the right, show a developer character at a laptop 
receiving infrastructure resources from a cloud. Use a clean color palette of 
tech blues (#0078D4, #50E6FF) and modern oranges (#FF8C00). Include subtle 
Kubernetes and cloud-native symbols. Flat design, professional but approachable.
```

### Version 3: Kitchen View

```
Create an isometric illustration showing a "cloud kitchen" with different 
stations. Show robotic chefs at various stations labeled with cloud icons 
(databases, storage, networks). In the foreground, show a developer character 
receiving a glowing "infrastructure combo meal box". Use bright, vibrant 
colors and a playful, modern style. Include digital order tickets floating 
between the counter and kitchen. Style should be tech-forward and whimsical 
without referencing specific brands.
```

### Version 4: Split View

```
Create a side-by-side comparison illustration. Left side: traditional fast-food 
counter with a customer ordering a meal, simple and colorful. Right side: the 
same scene but transformed into a tech setting - developer at a Kubernetes 
terminal "ordering" cloud infrastructure, receiving glowing cloud resources. 
Use consistent composition on both sides to show the parallel. Modern, clean 
style with bright blues, oranges, and whites. Include small arrows connecting 
similar elements between the two sides.
```

## Usage Notes

1. **For Article Header:** Use the Primary Prompt, 16:9 aspect ratio
2. **For Social Media:** Use Version 2, 1200x630 pixels
3. **For Presentation:** Use Version 3 or 4, high resolution
4. **For GitHub README:** Use Primary Prompt, 1200x600 pixels

## Post-Processing

After generating the image, consider:

1. Adding article title overlay in clean sans-serif font
2. Adding subtle gradient overlay for text readability
3. Ensuring sufficient contrast for accessibility
4. Optimizing file size for web (WebP or optimized PNG)
5. Creating variations for different platforms

## Example Variations to Try

### Variation A: Counter Focus
Emphasize the ordering counter, make it central, with the developer prominent in foreground.

### Variation B: Kitchen Focus
Show more of the "kitchen" operations, with multiple stations creating different resources in parallel.

### Variation C: Delivery Focus
Show the completed "meal" (infrastructure) being delivered/deployed to the developer.

### Variation D: Journey View
Show the complete journey: order → preparation → delivery in a flowing composition.

## Color Mood References

- **Tech-Friendly Blue:** Trustworthy, professional, modern
- **Energetic Orange:** Action, enthusiasm, approachability  
- **Bright Yellow:** Highlights, attention, positivity
- **Clean White/Gray:** Simplicity, clarity, modern

## Style References

Think of:
- Slack's friendly illustration style
- GitHub's octocat aesthetic
- Kubernetes documentation diagrams
- Modern SaaS landing page illustrations

## Testing the Image

Good header image should:
- ✅ Be immediately recognizable as tech-related
- ✅ Convey "simplicity" and "ordering"
- ✅ Be visually distinct from generic cloud images
- ✅ Work well at both large and thumbnail sizes
- ✅ Not be distracting or overly complex
- ✅ Complement the article title

## Final Selection Criteria

Choose the image that best:
1. Captures the "fast-food ordering" metaphor
2. Appeals to both technical and non-technical audiences
3. Stands out in search results and social feeds
4. Maintains professional quality
5. Aligns with Crossplane's branding (without using logos)
